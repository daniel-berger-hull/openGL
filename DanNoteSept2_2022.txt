From the NeHe projects in folder C:\data\Programming\Workspaces\C++\OpenGL\examples\NeHe\vc,

Check the following project as hints for techniques to add to my OpenGL projects:



Lesson 26  beach ball on glass
   Reflection on the glass is something to check who it is done..
   
 Priority  Medium

Lesson 27  true shadow
   Adding Shadows is very important, as if I do low poly projects, they seem to not use the Textures,
   and improving my lighting and adding shadow would be the best path to have nice rendering...

 Priority  Very High!
   
Lesson 30  ball scene
  It appears like Texture and Colored object are mixed in this project
  1 - To try see if that is the case
  2 - And if yes, what are the OpenGL setting to acheive this
  
 Priority  Medium
