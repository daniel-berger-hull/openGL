wxWidgetOpenGL --> Basic wxWidgets + OpenGL template, who could be a starting point for any simple OpenGL
                   project I want to do, while  using the wxWidgets lib as base for GUI
                   A simple face is displayed, and you can turn it using the mouse...
                   

wxWidgetOpenGLCube --> An evolved version of wxWidgetOpenGL, where an OBJ File (3D model) is red and 
			displayed by the render. Colors on the model are also rendered on the screen.

                         with an OpenGL Rendering
