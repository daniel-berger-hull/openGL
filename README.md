OpenGLCube --> Basic wxWidgets + OpenGL template, who could be a starting point for any simple OpenGL
                   project I want to do, while  using the wxWidgets lib as base for GUI
                   A 3 color cube is displayed, and you can turn it using the mouse...
                   

OpenGLSoccerBall --> An evolved version of wxWidgetOpenGL, where an OBJ File (3D model) is red and 
		     displayed by the render. Colors on the model are also rendered on the screen.
		     A Blue soccer ball is displayed (would need to fix as the back faces are visible)
			

OpenGLForest  --> A multi obj file demo, where trees and rocks are displayed


OpenGLArrayDraw --> Experiment to use OpenGL's glDrawArrays function, instead of using the typical
                    glBegin(GL_QUADS) or glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES). The 3D model has to be contained in 
                    arrays in a predetermined format and order...

OpenGLEditorTemplate --> Small project who could be used as a base for creating more complex editor
                         with an OpenGL Rendering
                
OpenGLForestLights--> Based on the OpenGLForest (for its visual content) and OpenGLEditorTemplate (for it use of a wxWidget right panel section),
                      to study the OpenGL lighting system
